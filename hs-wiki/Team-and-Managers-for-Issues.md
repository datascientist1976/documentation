The team working on HydroShare is quite large and distributed. Each issue in github is labeled based on its subject category with the following team members responsible for managing these subject categories.  Managing an issue is different from working on or resolving an issue.  The usual assigning mechanism in github should be used for the person designated to work on an issue.  Managing involves

 * Deciding on priority, i.e. associating the issue with a release
 * Assigning the issue to someone when it is prioritized, or self assigning or adjusting the assignment
 * Closing when done or no longer relevant (or checking that it gets closed)
 * Validating that issues are not prematurely closed
 * Changing to another category if appropriate
